chaotic-pendulum
================

Project for "Ausgew√§hlte Mehtoden zur Datenanalyse"/"Selected Methods for data analysis" at the DHBW Mannheim. 
It is a simulation of a double pendulum to view its chaotic motion. The effect that small changes in the 
initial state of the system results in drastic changes of the motion in the long run is also used to show
the errors of different ODE solvers (ode45, Forward-Euler, ...).
